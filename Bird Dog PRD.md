Bird Dog PRD
Name of Tool: AI Bird Dog
Problem: Users who are looking for a role in Consulting, Big Tech, Startups, etc. have trouble
identifying which roles they are actually a best fit for. There are so many roles with tags such as
“Analyst, Associate, Operations, Strategy, Product” etc. - and even though two jobs may have
the same title of “Senior Associate, Strategy” they may have two completely different functions
and candidate requirements in practice. The user ends up applying to too many jobs that sound
like a good fit, but actually do not play to their strengths at all.

Solution: An AI-powered workflow that takes inputs such as: user resume, a job description
(link or copied and pasted), The user’s ideal role, and whatever else the user finds relevant decomposes those inputs, applies structured reasoning, and generates strategic outputs and
insights.

Target User: Job Seekers
Core Use Case: A user uploads their resume, a description of their ideal role, and a job
posting. The system analyzes role requirements, maps them against the user’s strengths,
identifies strategic gaps, and generates multiple positioning pathways. Instead of simply
optimizing resumes, the tool helps users decide which roles are worth pursuing and how to
position themselves intelligently.

Decision Framework:
The system evaluates roles across three dimensions:
1.​ Skill Alignment: How well the user matches core requirements​
2.​ Trajectory Fit: Whether the role advances the user’s long-term goals​
3.​ Differentiation Potential: Whether the user can stand out vs typical candidates
Output:
●​
●​
●​
●​

“Apply aggressively”
“Apply with repositioning”
